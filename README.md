# Big-Piano-Project
# Undertook summer project through IEEE student club at CSULB along with student Kiyo Terao. 
# Tasked with creating a floor step piano as the one in the movie "Big" featuring Tom Hanks
# Researched along with partner ideas how to design project, including the wiring needed for circuit assembly, how to use touch switches for piano keys, and how to code microcontroller to emit respective piano key note over speakers
# Created circuit schematic for approval by IEEE Student club president
# Machined wooden pieces to fit preciesly be assembled and glued as piano foundation
# Wired circuit components such as resistors, arduino microcontroller, wired, and touch switches on piano foundation
# Documented project design as well as created presentations with project concepts for future students to attempt on their own.

#Files attached;
# Circuit Schematic
# Presentations #1-6 with project concepts
# Bill of Materials
